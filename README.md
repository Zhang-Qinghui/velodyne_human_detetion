# velodyne_human_detetion
This is the velodyne human deteion based on https://github.com/alvarovillena/velodyne_detect_person.git, but I modified most of of the static background part. 

It is tested on Ubuntu16.04 and ROS Kinect

It depends on Ice version 3.5.1 which you can simpply install it by 
```sh
sudo apt install ice35-*
```
